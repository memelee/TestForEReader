There is an effort underway to 'true-up' the eReader website experience so that it resembles closer to how the eReader iPad experience is.  This may include PDF availability and features/tools.

Font Type should match the iPad - in Authenticated and Unauthenticated View.
Add a low profile, low contract horizontal arrows to the left/right, when there is actually more at each level.  A dark gray arrow may be fine.  This convention for scrolling seems more modern than an actual scrollbar.  Amazon does something similar.
If you can add a tiny amount of momentum to the scroll experience, that would be nice too, so it doesn't feel so stiff.
In the Settings/Help section, we should have a link someplace to the WON website, www.williamoneil.com.
The thumbnail images on the product slides are not clickable - they should be.  Clicking on them should open the image.
The Product slides all show an XFL image in unauthenticated view.  This is the marketing section of the page.  Each Product slide should only s show that product information.
There is an Error for Invalid Address Format.  It shows a 404 page - instead, show the same theme of messaging as appears on the iPad.
The invalid password message should not show a 404 page - copy iPad.
